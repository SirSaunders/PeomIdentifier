the horse flies over the moon
shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon

too coldly or the stars howe'er it was
that dream was as that night wind let it pass

i have been happy, tho' in a dream
i have been happy- and i love the theme

dreams in their vivid coloring of life
as in that fleeting, shadowy misty strife

of semblance with reality which brings
to the delirious eye, more lovely things

of paradise and love and all our own
than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known

there is black and white roses on the stars howe'er it was
that dream was as that night wind let it pass

i have been happy, tho' in a dream
i have been happy- and i love the theme

dreams in their vivid coloring of life
as in that fleeting, shadowy misty strife

of semblance with reality which brings
to the delirious eye, more lovely things

of paradise and love and all our own
than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known

romance who loves to nod and sing
with drowsy head and folded wing

a vision, or in none
is it therefore the less gone

all that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream

i stand amid the roar
of a surf-tormented shore

and i hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand

how few yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
while i weep while i weep

o god can i not grasp
them with a tighter clasp

o god can i not save
one from the pitiless wave

is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream
