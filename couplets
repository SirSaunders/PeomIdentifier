Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope

So till the judgement that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes

Tir'd with all these from these would I be gone
Save that, to die I leave my love alone

You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

A little learning is a dangerous thing
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring

Be not the first by whom the new are tried
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside

Be thou the first true merit to befriend
His praise is lost who stays till all commend

Good nature and good sense must ever join
To err is human to forgive divine

Hope springs eternal in the human breast
Man never is but always to be blest

’Tis education forms the common mind
Just as the twig is bent the tree’s inclined

Take this kiss upon the brow
And, in parting from you now

You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream

Yet if hope has flown away
In a night or in a day

In a vision, or in none
Is it therefore the less gone

All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore

And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand

How few yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep while I weep

O God can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp

O God can I not save
One from the pitiless wave

Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream


Oh that my young life were a lasting dream
My spirit not awakening till the beam

Of an Eternity should bring the morrow
Yes tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow

And hath been still, upon the lovely earth
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth


In my young boyhood should it thus be given
Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven

For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright
I' the summer sky in dreams of living light

And loveliness have left my very heart"
In climes of my imagining, apart

From mine own home with beings that have been
Of mine own thought what more could I have seen

Twas once- and only once and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass some power

Or spell had bound me 'twas the chilly wind
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind

Its image on my spirit or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon

Too coldly or the stars howe'er it was
That dream was as that night wind let it pass

I have been happy, tho' in a dream
I have been happy- and I love the theme

Dreams in their vivid coloring of life
As in that fleeting, shadowy misty strife

Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye, more lovely things

Of Paradise and Love and all our own
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known

Romance who loves to nod and sing
With drowsy head and folded wing

Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake

While in the wild wood I did lie
A child—with a most knowing eye

She was a little tense
The notice made no sense

I saw a little hermit crab
His coloring was oh so drab

It’s hard to see the butterfly
Because he flies across the sky

Hear the honking of the goose
I think he’s angry at the moose

His red sports car is just a dream
It needs no gas, it runs on steam

The children like the ocean shore
We want to leave but they want more

I made the cookies one by one
I hear the bell, so they are done

My cat, she likes to chase a mouse,
Especially one that’s in the house

Lightening, thunder, all around
Soon the rain falls on the ground

I tire of writing poems and rhyme
I think I need vacation time

every inch and every corner of my country's land narrate a story
they tell the epic of brave women and men who fought for Algeria's glory
